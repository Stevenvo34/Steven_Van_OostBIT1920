Question 4
SELECT gene_name, (seq_region_end - seq_region_start + 1) AS length  FRom gene 
order by length desc limit 1 OFFSET 2

gene name : 'PARP1',  lenght : '2493040'


Question 5

SELECT g.gene_name, COUNT(*) AS nr_exons FROM gene g JOIN transcript t ON g.gene_id = t.gene_id 
group by g.gene_name order by nr_exons desc limit 1


gene name 'U6',      number of exons :  '1329'

Question 6

select chromosome, count(*) AS most_genes  FROM gene WHERE description like '%breast%' AND description like '%cancer%'
GROUP by chromosome ORDER BY most_genes DESC limit 1;

# chromosome, most_genes
'16', '2'

---- 
SELECT count(*) AS ammount_transcripts FROM gene g 
JOIN transcript t ON g.gene_id = t.gene_id 
WHERE g.chromosome = '16' order by ammount_transcripts

# ammount_transcripts
'3636'


Question 7

SELECT COUNT(*)FROM exon;
SELECT COUNT(*)FROM exon_transcript;

Exon transcript has alot more rows because there are more transcripts in the dataase.
